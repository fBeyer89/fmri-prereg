# Study Information

## Working title

A specific and informative description of your planned study. It doesn't have to
be the same title that you use for later publication.

## Authors

This can but does not need to include authorship order and/or contributions
planned for later publication.

## Description

Give a brief introduction with some background, purpose or aims of the study, or
broad research question to help to ensure your hypotheses are properly informed.
The recommended length is that of an abstract. One may also consider to write
this section as a concise introduction for the planned publication.

## Hypotheses

List each hypothesis you want to test as part of this study. Each hypothesis
should be specific, concise and testable. The table below can be used as a
checklist.

Be as specific as possible about your regions of interest (ROI) and definitions
of other relevant variables mentioned here. How to define your ROIs or
operationalize these relevant variables should be detailed in the section
**Variables** and **Analysis Plan**.

| ---------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| \_\_       | Is the hypothesis directional or non-directional?                                                                                                                                                                           |
| \_\_ or NA | If directional, state the directional relationship between your (manipulated or measured) variables.                                                                                                                        |
| \_\_ or NA | For interaction effects, describe the expected shape of the interactions.                                                                                                                                                   |
| \_\_ or NA | If you are manipulating a variable, formulate predictions for successful manipulation checks: What variables will you use to check whether your manipulation worked? If not, explain why no manipulation check is included. |
| \_\_or NA  | A figure or table with expected results, e.g., to describe complex interactions.                                                                                                                                            |
| \_\_or NA  | If multiple alternative predictions can be made for the same IV-DV combination, describe what outcome would be predicted by which theory.                                                                                   |
